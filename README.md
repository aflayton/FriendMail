==========
This was a class project for Programming Mobile Devices at PIT. The goal of this project was to apply what we had learned in Java I's CsvToGui project about parsing CSV data, and also applying what we learned from Web Programming about AJAX techniques. We also learned about how to use git and GitHub. We used PhoneGap Build to deploy our application to a mobile platform.
